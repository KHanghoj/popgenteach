# Exercise 2 #

## Ancient DNA and horse domestication ##


## Objective ##
The Objective of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with two methods, namely f3-outgroup and Treemix. Using these methods, we will investigate if the Botai horses were the ancestors of present domesticated horses.

In exercise 2 we will investigate if the botai horses are the ancestors of present day domesticated horses. To unravel this we will use two different methods, namely f3-outgroup and treemix. Both methods are based on genetic drifts. 

## f3-outgroup ##
The first method we will apply to the data is named f3-outgroup. This method uses an outgroup (Donkey) to recover the amount of shared genetic drift between two horses/populations. The statistic measures the branch length from the outgroup and split of the two populations. It is defined as the product of allele frequency differences between C-A and C-B [highlighted here in red](https://gaworkshop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/f3-tree.png). 

You will compute all pairwise permutations of the horses analyzed in this study and plot it as a heatmap. The color brightness indicates the amount of shared genetic drfit between two horses. These results can give us the first indication whether the domesticated Botai horses were the direct ancestors of present-day domesticated horses

## Treemix ##

In this exercise, every populations consists of a single individual.
